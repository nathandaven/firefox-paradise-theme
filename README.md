# Firefox Paradise Theme

_Last updated January 2025 - Supports Firefox 134.0.1+_

![startpage](https://github.com/nathandaven/startpage/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true)

My custom Firefox userChrome profile, setup with right handed vertical tabs, compact layout, and MacOS/Paradise colors theming.

See [nathandaven/startpage](https://github.com/nathandaven/startpage) for my accompanying start page extension.

This is designed custom fit for me, so don't expect much configurability. See [here](https://github.com/ranmaru22/firefox-vertical-tabs) for the more standard theme this is based on.

## Installation

0. go to about:config in your URL bar, search for toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets and set it to true
1. locate the firefox profile folder by going to the _hamburger menu_ > _help_ > _more torubleshooting information_
2. click _show in finder_ or _open folder_ next to profile folder
3. open the highlighted folder (should look something like "13s123f4.default-release")
4. create a folder named "chrome" if it doesn't exist already
5. paste files from repo into this folder, or `git clone https://github.com/nathandaven/firefox-paradise-theme.git` and restart firefox (command-q/alt-f4 and reopen)
6. install Tab Center Reborn
7. open the extension settings, enable compact mode, and copy the contents of `tab-center-reborn.css` into the stylesheet section
8. profit

Decided to manage these files in a github repo for better maintainability. See here for the original gists:
